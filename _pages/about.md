I am an assistant professor in mathematics, with research in nonlinear dynamics. At Clarkson, I am affiliated with:

  - [Department of Mathematics](https://www.clarkson.edu/math)
  - [Clarkson Center for Complex Systems Science](https://www.clarkson.edu/c3s2)
  - [Institute for STEM Education](https://www.clarkson.edu/stem)
  - [Institute for Sustainable Environment](https://www.clarkson.edu/ise)


I teach classes in dynamical systems (ODEs, maps, numerical algorithms), and other mathematical topics.

I additionally serve as the Graduate Committee Chair for the Department of Mathematics.

I was born in Zagreb, Croatia where I lived until graduation from [UNIZG-FER](https://www.fer.unizg.hr) in 2006. After that, I moved to Santa Barbara, CA to get my PhD at [UC Santa Barbara](https://me.ucsb.edu), then Madison, WI for a postdoc at [University of Wisconsin, Madison](https://math.wisc.edu) and now finally to Potsdam, NY.
