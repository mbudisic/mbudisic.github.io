Koopman operator is a linear representation of nonlinear dynamics by an infinite-dimensional composition operator. Due to linearity, Koopman operator approach to analysis of nonlinear dynamics allows one to use familiar notions from spectral theory: spectrum, eigenfunctions, eigenvalues, etc. (Un)fortunately, Koopman operators are typically infinite-dimensional, even when the underlying systems are finite-dimensional, as they act on function spaces over the state space of the original dynamics.

My interests lie in understanding how choices of function spaces affect the approximations to the Koopman operator, how accurately certain features can be approximated, and how different approximation approaches “zero-in” on different aspects of dynamics, e.g., regular behavior vs. irregular behavior."
