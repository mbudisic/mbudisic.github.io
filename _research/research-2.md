title: "Braid dynamics"
excerpt: "Braids are mathematical structures, originating in algebraic topology, that capture topology of dynamical trajectories “dancing” around each other, without storing their precise locations. This makes them both computationally efficient and tolerant to errors in measurement. An important application of braids is in analyzing behavior of oceans from very limited set of measurements.

Collaboration with Jean-Luc Thiffeault (UW Madison), Michael Allshouse (Northeastern), Margaux Filippi (MIT), and Tom Peacock (MIT).
