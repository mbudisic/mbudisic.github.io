  <figcaption>Construction of a braid from trajectories.</figcaption>
</figure>Braids are mathematical structures, originating in algebraic topology, that capture topology of dynamical trajectories “dancing” around each other, without storing their precise locations. This makes them both computationally efficient and tolerant to errors in measurement. An important application of braids is in analyzing behavior of oceans from very limited set of measurements.

Mathematics of braids are interesting as well --- what are parallels with linear algebra, lessons from probability and statistics, and connections to dynamical systems theory.

This work is a collaboration with Jean-Luc Thiffeault (UW Madison), Michael Allshouse (Northeastern), Margaux Filippi (MIT), and Tom Peacock (MIT).
